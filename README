This Tarball is comprised of 4 files:

1. README:
	A file designed to lay out the contents of the tarball, and elaborate on the functionality, if any of other files

2. lab0.c:
	The source code file for project0 in CS 111. It is a simple input to output redirection program designed to leverage the dup() function
	The options the program contains are:
	a. --input=filename: where input is taken from a file rather than the default STDIN
	b. --output=fileneame: directs the input data into a file rather than the default STDOUT
	c. --segfault: forces a segfault when the program is run
	d. --catch: catches and logs a segfault if it occurs
3. Makefile: 
	The file which compiles and executes lab0 under different conditions
	a. make: compile the executable for lab0
	b. make check: run a smoke test to check for functionality in lab0.
			I checked for the --input and --output flags, along with the --catch and --segfault flags as well
	c. make clean: force the removal for the executable, tarball and any extraneous files
	d. make dist: creates the tarball with the 5 files required for submission  (2 png's, 1 README, 1 .c file, 1 Makefile)
4. Backtrace.png: 
	A screenshot with the backtrace of the segfault option being run in gdb

5. Breakpoint.png:
	A screenshot with the breakpoint after taking the fault in gdb
